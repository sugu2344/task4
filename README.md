# Income Expense Calculator 
Created a fully functional Income Expense Calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project should allow the users to add, edit, and delete income and expense entries, providing an overview of their financial status. The project will implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations to manage the data.

=>Include 3 filters [ “all”, “income”, “expense” ] to get only the needed data. 

=>Include input fields for entering income and expense details (e.g., description, amount).

=>Added local storage functionality to persist data across sessions
